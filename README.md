## :arrows_clockwise: Versions

This repository comes configured with 2 of the industry standards for development tools: **Webpack** and **Vite**. <br />
Both tools support **SWC (Speedy Web Compiler)**, a **Rust-based compiler**; Vite is optimized for it out of the box.

### Vite (SWC compiler)

Is a simple and fast solution thanks to it's "zero-config" approach which offers a smoother development experience.

### Webpack (Babel compiler)

Is more a flexible solution, capable of handling complex configurations.
